> A simple functional utility library.

## Summary

There are a few functions I use quite often that don't necessitate importing a larger library like ramda, so I just include them here. Also, I have some specific versions of functions I really like (e.g. `get` with a default value).

## Development

```
npm install
npm run test
npm run build
```
